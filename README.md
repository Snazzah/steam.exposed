## steam.exposed

A small project that breaks down the data given by Steam's Year in Review, made in a week.

You can also replace `s.team` in the share URLs to `steam.exposed`. So links like https://steam.exposed/y23/jcwvbbg work as a share link.

I plan to add stuff on top later, feel free to contribute if you like it.
